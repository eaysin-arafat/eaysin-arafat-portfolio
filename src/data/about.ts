    "In my initial job, I contributed to the development of various websites using React JS skills while working part-time at a company.",
    "Then I shifted to Excel Technologies Ltd., where I have been working and have completed several projects. For instance, the Healthcare Ecosystem and Helpdesk. The Healthcare Ecosystem is a government project that manages all health-related issues, such as doctors, patients, doctor-patient relationships, various departments, age-wise information, and UI changes based on patient data. The Helpdesk project generally resolves all system problems through role-based management. These projects utilize technologies like TypeScript, React JS, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, Tailwind CSS, and others.",
    "Additionally, I have personal projects like an eCommerce project, a Hotel Management System, and a JavaScript utility library (which hasnâ€™t been published anywhere, created for enhancing problem-solving skills). I used Javascript in my library project, and JavaScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS in other personal projects.",
    "Currently, I am studying clean code, data structures, algorithms, and backend development.",
